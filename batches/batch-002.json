In Star Trek Continues (episode 8, \"Still Treads the Shadow\"), Defiant is duplicated during its passage through the interdimensional rift into interphasic space with only a duplicate Kirk aboard. Over the next two hundred years, it gains a sentient AI who attempts to bring it back into the prime universe. The attempt has potentially disastrous consequences and is foiled by both Kirks, the duplicate returning to interphasic space. A Defiant is mentioned, but not seen (except for a wireframe graphic) in Star Trek Discovery, Season One.Oddly, though the Defiant appears in TOS, the Star Fleet Technical Manual lists no Defiant in any of the starship classes mentioned though the book was published seven years after the fact. However, there are several classes not listed in the publication. The Defiant is listed as a Bonhomme Richard subclass of the Constitution class. In the Star Fleet Technical Manual, it lists the registry number of \"NCC-1764\" as belonging to the Galina. Since the Defiant appears in an episode, and the Galina does not, then the Defiant is the sole owner of the NCC-1764. But, one possibility is, the number was attached to the Galina after the disappearance of the Defiant."
