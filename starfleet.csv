But unlike many of his other conjectural Constitution-class registry numbers, the 2006 remastered version of the series afforded no opportunity to bring this ship to canon. The reference book Star Fleet Technical Manual also listed a Constitution-class starship with the name Valiant but assigned with the registry NCC-1709. The 1973 Franz Joseph Blueprints list this ship as NCC-1709 also."

USS Excalibur,NCC-1664,Constitution,"Severely damaged and crew killed during Richard Daystrom's M5 computer test. In TOS episode ""The Ultimate Computer"", the death of its entire crew is established, however, the status of the Excalibur itself is unclear. It is not determined whether the ship was destroyed or severely damaged. The Star Trek Chronology (2nd ed., p. 88) stated that the ship was destroyed. The fourth edition of the Star Trek Encyclopedia offered two possibilities of the conditions of the Excalibur – the ship was severely damaged in (vol. 1, p. 254) or accidentally destroyed in (vol. 2, p. 329). Even though the episode itself provided no firm confirmation either way. The 1973 Franz Joseph Blueprints list this ship as NCC-1705."

Later, it is revealed she was taken by Mirror Universe Tholians, captured by the crew of the ISS Enterprise (NX-01), and then used in the service of the Terran Empire in ""In a Mirror, Darkly"". In Star Trek Continues (episode 8, ""Still Treads the Shadow""), Defiant is duplicated during its passage through the interdimensional rift into interphasic space with only a duplicate Kirk aboard. Over the next two hundred years, it gains a sentient AI who attempts to bring it back into the prime universe. The attempt has potentially disastrous consequences and is foiled by both Kirks, the duplicate returning to interphasic space. A Defiant is mentioned, but not seen (except for a wireframe graphic) in Star Trek Discovery, Season One.Oddly, though the Defiant appears in TOS, the Star Fleet Technical Manual lists no Defiant in any of the starship classes mentioned though the book was published seven years after the fact. However, there are several classes not listed in the publication. The Defiant is listed as a Bonhomme Richard subclass of the Constitution class. In the Star Fleet Technical Manual, it lists the registry number of ""NCC-1764"" as belonging to the Galina. Since the Defiant appears in an episode, and the Galina does not, then the Defiant is the sole owner of the NCC-1764. But, one possibility is, the number was attached to the Galina after the disappearance of the Defiant."
